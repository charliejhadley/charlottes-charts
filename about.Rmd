  Is this your... third blog now?

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

I've had several failed R blogs which tried to do too many things:

- <www.visibledata.co.uk> was designed as the company website for my R consultancy work. It was abandoned in favour of...

- <www.findingyourway.io> was to accompany a book project I abandoned. It has lots of wonderfully customised (Bootstrap flavoured) CSS.

But these days I do my consultancy through the awesome [R for The Rest of Us](https://rfortherestofus.com/) team. That's also where my [fancy markety blogposts](https://rfortherestofus.com/2022/03/heatmaps/).

This is going to be the home for #30DayChartChallenge, #TidyTuesday and other things.

To prevent this from going the way of the abandoned projects, here are my rules:

- All custom CSS needs to be declared here.

- All {distill} modifications need to be declared here.

## Customisations

### Showing recent posts on the home page

The home page shows a list of all blogposts, which is achieved by adding this to the `index.Rmd` file:

```{yml}
---
title: "Posts"
listing: posts
site: distill::distill_website
---
```

To place additional content about the posts I make use of `<d-byline></d-byline>` which forces the content below into a comfortable position.
