I‚Äôm Charlie (she/her) and\nhave been teaching and consulting with R and Shiny since 2016.\nI co-run the awesome R in 3 Months programme\nat R for the Rest of\nUs.\nI have 5 courses about R available on LinkedIn\nLearning\nI‚Äôm very proud of this Mapping with R\ncourse which is designed for folks without mapping or GIS\nexperience.\nAs well as these things, I‚Äôm a trans and LGBT rights activist üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà. All tech is\npolitical. Black Lives Matter.\nWhat‚Äôs this blog for?\nI‚Äôve had several failed R blogs which tried to do too many\nthings:\nwww.visibledata.co.uk was\ndesigned as the company website for my R consultancy work. It was\nabandoned in favour of‚Ä¶\nwww.findingyourway.io was to\naccompany a book project I abandoned. It has lots of wonderfully\ncustomised (Bootstrap flavoured) CSS.\nBut these days I do my consultancy through the awesome R for The Rest of Us team.\nThat‚Äôs also where my fancy markety\nblogposts.\nThis is going to be the home for #30DayChartChallenge, #TidyTuesday\nand other things.\nTo prevent this from going the way of the abandoned projects, here\nare my rules:\nAll custom CSS needs to be declared here.\nAll {distill} modifications need to be declared here.\nCustomisations\nShowing recent posts on\nthe home page\nThe home page shows a list of all blogposts, which is achieved by\nadding this to the index.Rmd file:\n\n---\ntitle: \"Posts\"\nlisting: posts\nsite: distill::distill_website\n---\n\nTo place additional content about the posts I make use of\n<d-byline><\/d-byline> which forces the content\nbelow into a comfortable position.\nTutorials used\nhttps://themockup.blog/posts/2020-08-01-building-a-blog-with-distill/\n\n\n\n",

I‚Äôm an R instructor and data science consultant. ddThis is a\nportfolio of my courses, charts and other things that don‚Äôt have a good\nhome elsewhere.
